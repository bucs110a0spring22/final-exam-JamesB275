Summary of Program:
Essentially,this program should provide the user a fairly reliable way to determine if they have the day off as long as they live in New York. The first API, Calender inadiutorium API, is a simple liturgical calender for the catholic church. It prints out the liturgical season, whether today is a weekend or weekday, and some other religion-oriented things. However, it will not print out if today is a non-catholic holiday or not. The Holiday isdayoff API will print out either 0 or 1 if today is a federal holiday. The program I wrote will determine if today is a weekend or weekday and if today is a holiday or not to show you if you have the day off. Through combining the information in these two APIs, I have written a meaningful program that will tell you if you go to work or not.
